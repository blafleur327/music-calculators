    <h1>Music Theory Calculators:</h1>
    <div id="main">
        <div class="sub">
            <h3>Purpose:</h3>
            <p>This project is a component of my PhD (LSU 2026) dissertation on post-tonal music theory pedagogy and how visualization other than the score might increase understanding.</p>
            <p>My primary motivation for this project is to provide learners and experienced analysts access to a more intuition forward way of approaching post-tonal music theory.
                Since my musical insterests often lie outside of the twelve-tone chromatic universe, all of these calculators except for the Neo-Riemannian one (for now!) permit larger and smaller universes.
                This is to encourage G-SPACE analysis, beat-class, and microtonal exploration using the tools and terminology from pitch-class set theory and mathematical music theories. (But with a more pedagogical spin).</p>
            <p>The aim of this program is to encourage learning and intuition about pitch/rhythmic structures that are perhaps not as easily understood by looking at the score itself.</p>
            <p>This program is fully web based. The files are: JS, CSS, and HTML. I have included the Bravura.woff2 files to render certain music glyphs. The only library dependency is SVG.js, used to build some of the visualizations.</p>

            <h3>Calculator Descriptions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A <a href="../PCSetCalculator/pc_set_calculator_v6.html">pitch-class/beat-class calculator</a> centered around a clockface diagram. It includes results such as: Normal and Prime Form, Interval Class and Index Vector, and a Maximal Evenness check. It also permits superset and subset selection, with the subset allowing T<sub><em>n</em></sub>, T<sub><em>n</em></sub>I, and M<sub><em>n</em></sub> operations if the result is included in the prevailing superset.
                    </li>
                <li>A <a href="../Matrix Calculator/serial_calculator_v3.html">serialism/matrix calculator</a> that is searchable for adjacent elements or a specific set-class. It returns results for generalized n-chordal combinatoriality, derivation, and all-interval status. Row-form selection will highlight ordinal invariance between each of the selected forms. 
                    </li>
                <li>A <a href="../Glossary/glossary.html">glossary of terminology</a>. Many of these definitions are my own, but often include examples and/or links to papers/webpages with additional information.
                    </li>
                <li>A <a href="../Rotational Arrays/rotational_arrays.html">rotational array calculator</a> that permits alpha/beta and gamma/delta arrays from an input tonerow. 
                    </li>
                <li>A Neo-Riemannian <a href="../UTT/utt.html">Flip-Flop Circle calculator</a> that draws cycles of any length. It permits standard Schritt and Wechsel names {P,L,R,S,N,H,...} or Uniform Triad Transformations (UTT)s. It also compiles the associated pitch-class content, helping to connect the synthetic scales to the symmetrical harmonic progressions.
                    </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Future Plans:</h3>
            <p>Here are a few ideas I hope to implement in the future:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PC/BC Calculator:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Note Names for more tuning systems including 24-EDO, 72-EDO, etc.</li>
                        <li>Audio playback using Tone.js.</li>
                        <li>SVG image download.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Neo-Riemannian:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Support for non-tertian structures.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Glossary:
                    <ul>
                        <li>More definitions and links.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Last Thoughts:</h3>
            <p>To you who have much more programming experience, these might look a bit lackluster. But I am constantly learning and revising them to increase functionality and improve design features.</p>
            <p>If you find these tools useful, please share them with others!</p>
